P/Invoke bindings for [DLPack](http://github.com/dmlc/dlpack). It demonstrates consuming from C# a DLPack tensor produced in a C function.

Hopefully there will be official bindings: https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack/issues/56 and https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/4162.

Currently there is no example for constructing a DLPack tensor in C# and sending it to a C function.

Limitations: due to [`ReadOnlySpan<T>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.readonlyspan-1.-ctor?view=netcore-3.1#System_ReadOnlySpan_1__ctor_System_Void__System_Int32_) supporting only Int32 lengths, the `ROS<T>`-returning method is called `DataSpanLessThan2Gb()`. Issues: https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/issues/896 and https://github.com/dotnet/apireviews/tree/master/2016/11-04-SpanOfT#spant-and-64-bit. This code assumes Linux, but could be made to work on Windows with a different Makefile.
